Free inventory management solution

## About

This is intended to be a cheap alternative to buying barcode readers, configuring the reads and setting up a database. Many smaller companies may be able to spend large sums of money managing their inventory but it is a task that must be done regardless.

## Usage

Many items that need to be tracked should have an assoicated barcode. If not possible, we can generate paper barcodes to scan or attach to items for scanning.
